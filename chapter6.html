        </p>
        <h2>Building a Quality Email List
        </h2>
        <p>A successful email marketing campaign starts with a quality email list. Focus on building a list of engaged subscribers who are interested in your content. Strategies for building your list include:
        </p>
        <ul id="narrow">
            <li>Lead Magnets: Offer valuable resources such as ebooks, checklists, or free trials in exchange for email addresses.
            </li>
            <li>Sign-Up Forms: Place sign-up forms on your website, blog, and social media profiles. Make it easy for visitors to subscribe.
            </li>
            <li>Pop-Ups: Use exit-intent pop-ups to capture email addresses before visitors leave your site.

            <li>Contests and Giveaways: Run contests or giveaways that require email sign-up to enter.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Crafting Compelling Subject Lines
        </h2>
        <p>The subject line is the first thing recipients see, and it determines whether they open your email. A compelling subject line should be:
        </p>
        <ul id="narrow">
            <li>Attention-Grabbing: Use power words, curiosity, and urgency to grab attention.
            </li>

        </ul>
        <h2>Writing Engaging Email Copy
        </h2>
        <p>Once you’ve captured your audience’s attention with the subject line, the body of your email needs to deliver value and encourage action. Key elements of engaging email copy include:
